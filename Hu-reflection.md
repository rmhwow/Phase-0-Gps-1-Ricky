What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was a little confused about the distinction between local branches and Github branches.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The distinction was made clear as they are two separate environments where the branches exist independently.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I wondered whether empty directories created locally will be copied to Github and was told that only files and their containing directories are tracked by Git.

What still confuses you about git?
I feel that I pretty much understand all the materials that are covered so far. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was delightful.
